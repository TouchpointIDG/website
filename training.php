						Touchpoint International Development Group specializes in the planning, development and execution of advanced SOF and intelligence related training.  Members of our staff have been responsible for the creation and management of some of the most ground breaking, long term training programs within the Preparation of the Environment (PE) operational spectrum. In a training environment where antiquated tactics, mis-application of technical resources and operationally irrelevant training are commonplace, Touchpoint strives to raise the standard in high quality, specialized training.  Our subject matter experts (SME’s) have all successfully applied their respective skill sets in hostile and high threat environments, this experience allows for in depth case studies and relevant operational “lessons learned” to be applied to every training delivery that we provide.
					</p>
					<p>
						Functional and realistic exercises in support of advanced SOF skill sets require complex synchronization, dynamic and experienced role players and scenario depth that allows controlled “free play” by the exercise participants.  Touchpoint provides professional scenario developers, exercise controllers, seasoned role players and a full spectrum “red team” to ensure that participants are immersed into a realistic and evolving exercise.  Our goal is to always ensure that training tasks are achieved without the use of administrative injects and that the exercise remain fluid enough for the participants to safely apply a reasonable degree of operational freedom.  Additionally, our staff will provide in depth reporting and AAR’s at the required interval and upon completion of the exercise.
