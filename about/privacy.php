							Privacy Policy
						</h3>
						<h4>
							Last Updated: May 18th 2017
						</h4>

						<p>
							Touchpoint International Development Group Inc, referred to as "TPIDG" henceforth is dedicated
							to protecting our customer's privacy and security while providing information and helpful tools
							throughout our website.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>
							What Information Do We Collect?
						</h5>
						<p>
							We collect the least amount of information possible while still collecting enough to provide
							services to our customers and improve our website based on usability and other requirements
							(such as hardware upgrades).
							We do this through various mediums, detailed below:
						</p>
						<ul class="privacy-lists">
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Information You Give Us.</strong> There are two times we will ask for information:
									when you submit a contact request through our contact form or when you register for an account.
									When you submit a contact request, we ask for your name, your email address and phone number.
									You are not required to provide any real information to us through this form, but we suggest
									you control the email address or phone number you submit if you want a response. We highly
									encourage the use of email and phone number forwarding services and do not block any of this
									on our contact form. In the same sense, when you register for an account, you may use any email
									address and username as long as you can verify that you are in control of that email address
									through an automated verification process. An email address is the only piece of personal
									information we require for registration, but you may provide more if you wish.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Information We Collect To Ensure Security.</strong> Security is a number one concern for us
									and we take it very seriously. We may sometimes collect information such as IP Addresses and user agent
									strings to block spammers and unauthorized crawlers.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Google Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics only to get a rough estimate of how many
									customers are visiting our site in a given period of time. We only use this on a few informational
									pages and do not have this enabled on any logged in pages such as our OSINT search tools. The pages
									that currently have Google Analytics actively running: index.php, about.php, careers.php, newsletters.php.
									For additional information on Google Analytics, please read Google's privacy policy.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Cloudflare.</strong> As a growing small business, we do not have the bandwidth to protect against
									a DDOS attack or other large scale attacks. Because of these restrictions, we utilize Cloudflare to
									help mitigate some of these risks. Cloudflare holds our TLS certificate and controls our DNS servers. In the
									future, we plan to eliminate the need for Cloudflare, but for now it is in our best interest.
									For additional information on Cloudflare, please read Cloudflare's privacy policy.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Web Server Logs.</strong> Several programs running on our web servers provide automatic
									logs to help us discover errors and protect our digital infrastructure from malicious hackers. One
									example of this is Apache which automatically stores connection logs and other identifiable information.
									These logs are cleaned as regurlarly as possible and are only kept as long as needed for security and
									error reporting.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>
							How Do We Use Your Information?
						</h5>
						<p>
							TPIDG will never sell or share your information with any third parties or organizations. Any information collected
							directly by us is only for internal use and is only given to employees for specific purposes
							to provide services to our customers.
							We does this through various mediums, detailed below:
						</p>
						<ul class="privacy-lists">
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>To Communicate With You.</strong> We may communicate with you when you submit a request through our
									contact form or when setting up your account using only information you provide voluntarily. We may also
									reach out to you if there is an issue with your account.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Account Related Services.</strong> We may use information such as your email address for automated
									account creation. We may also use automated tools to display or modify pages based on your user agent string
									for a better experience and enhanced security.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>To Ensure Security Of Our Systems.</strong> We may use collected logs or analytics to block or redirect
									certain IP addresses or email addresses based on malicious activity or excessive spam. We don't link this
									information back to our users in any way and only use it to protect our systems.
								</p>
							</li>
