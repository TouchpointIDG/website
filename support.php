						Touchpoint currently provides operational support to the U.S. Government through our technical integration advisors, all-source analysts and tactical cyber consultants.  These operational support positions have proven vital to the continued success of the organizations that we support while allowing Touchpoint SMEâ€™s to maintain operational currency in their skill sets and, when appropriate, cascade relevant lessons learned into select training deliveries. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Touchpoint also provides operational support to the private sector, primarily through network penetration testing, data protection and threat modeling conducted by our information security consultants.  Additional support to the private sector includes: counter-corporate espionage, threat vulnerability assessments and corporate identity management.
