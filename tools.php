						Touchpoint provides unbiased technical equipment consultancy and full spectrum technical equipment training.  Our training approach to technical integration is dramatically different from many companies that specialize in technical equipment training.  Touchpoint focuses on the application of technical theory and the development of operational proficiency as opposed to the sequential “buttonology” training approach that many companies utilize.  Our technical integration specialists have all operationalized their respective skill sets in hostile and austere environments for the best specialized elements in the world.  They take great pride in their ability to teach students how to maximize collection efforts while reducing the risk of compromise through meticulous mission analysis and detailed planning. 
						<br><br>
						Additionally, Touchpoint has teamed with pioneering technology companies that develop and manufacture cutting edge capabilities that support cyber exploitation, full spectrum technical collection and electronic warfare products. These companies have all been identified as industry leaders and their niche technical solutions have dramatically increased the targeting capabilities of US and UK SOF.
